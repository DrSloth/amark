# Amark
A very simple markup language usable for parsing files and "streaming" tokens into another 
represantation. This was written to generate some specialized HTML for Wordpress but it is just 
the parser and not the converter.

For an example of the syntax check out [example_files/simple_reference.amark](./example_files/simple_reference.amark)
